# Python-projects
Beginner level python projects that showcase my understanding of the following concepts in python. These projects were completed on the basis of fulfiling a desire to showcaase my understanding of basic and intermediate concepts in python, and to easily make a point that I can develop solutions using python.

- basic syntax
- data types
- string manipulation
- loops
- condtional statements
- functions
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming) - classes
- file handling 
- error handling

### Project overview
1. **Age calculator**: 
2. __Memory game__
3. __Password manager__
4. __Rock paper scissors game__
5. __Temperature converter__
6. __Tic Tac Toe game__


> It is important to note that all the projects here are all command line (terminal) based.

### 1. Age calculator 
---
This program is just a simple calculator for age, as it uses the datetime function to process your input with regards to your birthday, and give the difference of that date in relation to today. It is just a rudementary program to showcase my understanding of the datetime function.

### 2. Memory game 
---
This is a terminal based game I created in order to strengthen my ability to memorize items. I simply used loops and a list (to store the items that are meant to be memorized).
### 3. Password manager 
---
This is CLI based password manager that can store your passwords for you. It does something a little different though, as it annonymises the master password that would be used to query the stored passwords. It is also secure enough not to store the reference files as clear text, but as hidden binary. I also used the hashlib module to create an encrypted form of the master password, as well as the getpass module to obfuscate the master password.
### 4. Rock paper scissors 
---
This is a simple rock paper scissors game that leverages on loops and a lot of conditional statements. It also keeps track of the scores as well. Granted it may not be as exciting as it sounds, but it is functional.
### 5. Temperature converter
---
This is a simple temperature converter from celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. This project was done for the sake of serving a utility for me. I used functions to make this possible.
### 6. TicTactoe
---
In order to test my understanding of OOP (classes), I created a TicTacToe game. This is a CLI version, hence all the fun of the visual appeal may have been sucked out of it, but it is very functional. This project used lots of conditions and methods to meet up with the rule definition of the game. The premise for the setup of the spaces for each user input was based on the matrix system using a list to hold entry. The game was designed to be a 2 player game.
